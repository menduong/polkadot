=== Building the image

To build your own image from the source, you can run the following command:

	1. ./docker/build.sh
	2. docker images (show image polkafoundry/polkadot:latest)
NOTE: Building the image takes a while. Count at least 30min on a good machine.

=== Run Polkafoundry docker test

	1. cd polkadot/docker
	2. make up
	3. check url: https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9944#/explorer

=== Stop docker test
	make down
